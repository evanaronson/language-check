/**
 * The writer's text plus every suggested edit, and which ones they've accepted.
 * Immutable: each action returns a new Revision.
 *
 * Rules, where a rewording and a fix "touch" as defined by [Edit.touches]:
 * 1. Edits of the same kind never touch each other.
 * 2. Rewordings are written on top of the corrected text, so a rewording already
 *    includes every fix it touches. The rewording wins.
 * 3. Accepting a rewording retires the fixes it touches. A retired fix is no longer
 *    offered: not shown, not counted, not applied by Replace all.
 * 4. Accepting a fix leaves the rewordings that touch it on offer. Accepting one of
 *    them later replaces the fix along with the rest of the phrase.
 * 5. Fixes a rewording doesn't touch stay on offer, because the rewording assumes them.
 * 6. Replace all accepts a kind's remaining edits as one action.
 * 7. Undo reverts the last action, bringing back what it accepted and what that retired.
 * The working text is the original with the accepted edits applied, leaving out
 * accepted fixes that an accepted rewording replaced.
