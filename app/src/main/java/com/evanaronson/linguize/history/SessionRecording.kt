/**
 * Turns what happens on one card into history records. Pure Kotlin: it never touches
 * storage, the caller saves what it returns. One instance per session (per check()).
 *
 * The caller reports, in order: the start (constructor), each attempt as it finishes,
 * every change to the revision the writer makes (accept, accept all, undo), copies,
 * and finally the close. See docs/history-spec.md, "Decisions, defined".
 *
 * The suggestions decided at the close are those of the *decided revision*: the last
 * one an attempt offered. An attempt that offers none (it failed, or found the text
 * unclear) leaves the previous revision decided, because the card keeps that revision's
 * accepted changes and applies them if the writer replaces the text; only an attempt
 * with a revision of its own makes the previous one's suggestions [Decision.Superseded].
 * What was accepted and what was copied is tracked per revision, since a re-check carries
 * identical accepted edits over as new edits ([Revision.acceptMatching]). A change to a
 * revision other than the decided one (a late report from an earlier attempt) is ignored,
 * and so is everything once closed.
