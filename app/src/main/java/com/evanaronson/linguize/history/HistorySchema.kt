/*
 * The SQLite shape of history, and the mapping between rows and records. Pure Kotlin
 * with no Android in it, so the mapping is unit-tested; SqliteHistoryStore runs it.
 *
 * Columns are named exactly like the fields of the records, so a row in a SQLite browser
 * reads like the JSON it exports as. Enums are stored as their tokens ([Tokens]) and read
 * leniently. `attempts` is JSON (it's kept for re-deriving things later, never queried);
 * everything else is a real column. Identifiers are always double-quoted because `end` is
 * an SQL keyword.
 *
 * Versions: 1 was the first history build (enums stored by constant name, no `status`
 * at first, an attempt's answer under `verdict`); 2 adds `nativeLanguage` and stores
 * tokens and `raw`; 3 stores the requested language as a code and an attempt's failure
 * as a token. [upgrade] says how to get from each older version to this one.
